# AHHA
When your hard at work and an Idea pops into mind, use `ahha` to quickly jot it down.

## Usage Spec
`ahha` will crate a git repository at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ahha` with a README.md file in it. When ever you run `ahha` it will open the readme with `$EDITOR`. When you quit the editor, if the branch is dirty ahha will prompt you for a commit message. 

## Inspired by
ahha is inspired by [eureka](https://github.com/simeg/eureka).
